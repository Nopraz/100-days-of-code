# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp on the React Challenges. I stopped at "Create a Stateful Component"

**Thoughts** I feel like i'm making progress in React and that i can do some things on my own

### Day 2: August 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 14 exercises on FreeCodeCamp on the React Challenges. I stopped at "Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods"

**Thoughts** It was a bit harder on the challenge "Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods" because if forgot to use this.setState and modified the state directly instead

**Points to work on** Listeners in javascript

### Day 3: August 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a new little project : A minecraft server management application

The goal is to manage my local server (Start/Stop Server and minecraft service) directly from one interface. 
I already did this in PHP but i wanted to do it in React/Node JS

**Points to work on** My attention and patience

### Day 4: August 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished React challenges on learn.freecodecamp.org

**Points to work on** I will now try to learn Redux and work on my little project

### Day 5: August 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Advanced through my minecraft server manager project
So far now i can see the players connected with their avatar and the possibility of downloading there skins (Thanks crafatar)
I can also send rcon commands to my server and see the result in real time with the use of socket.io on the console output

I also managed to push to production my react and node app on a raspberry pi but with some problem with CORS 

**Points to work on** Deployment on my raspberry pi, design of my application in general (Bootstrap but no margin are used so everything is very compact)
