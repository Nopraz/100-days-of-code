# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp on the React Challenges. I stopped at "Create a Stateful Component"

**Thoughts** I feel like i'm making progress in React and that i can do some things on my own

### Day 2: August 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through 14 exercises on FreeCodeCamp on the React Challenges. I stopped at "Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods"

**Thoughts** It was a bit harder on the challenge "Manage Updates with Lifecycle Methods" because if forgot to use this.setState and modified the state directly instead

**Points to work on** Listeners in javascript
